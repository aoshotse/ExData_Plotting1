### A Few Things Concerning your Working Directory

* Before running the r scripts in this repo, ensure that your working directory contains the UCI file: "household_power_consumption.txt"

* It can be downloaded from: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

 Unzipped, and then placed in the working directory.

* Please be aware that running the scripts will write a .png plot to your working directory

  - Thanks!
